## About this prototype

This is just a prototype application and the official App might differ or even work in a whole different way. I did this to demonstrate what are the possibilities. 

##Tools and Technology used

This prototype utilised the super-heroic capabilities of [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/), html5 and css3. The app demonstrates angular's MV* structure, Routing and two-way data binding among others.

The app is styled using bootsrap and it also uses Angular's [ngAnimate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) module which adds some interactivity. The App is fully responsive hence, it works well on hand held devices plus desktops as well.

##Can it be made to a Native Mobile App?

Hell, yeah!
Since the app is made in pure html5 and javascript as its code base, adding a webView wrapper with applications such as [phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) or [appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/), can help us achieve just that. This would result in a hybrid mobile application with native capabilites such as, camera access, location detection just to name but a few.

#Downloading and running

Clone the git repo
```
https://github.com/joeynimu/refunite-search-app-prototype.git
```
Or simply download the zip file on your computer.

Open the index.html file on your browser and start interacting with the App.

##Emulating and Testing in Mobile Devices; Android/IOS

The App is made using html5 and javascript and it should work on Android and IOS.

To test this, [install ripple emulator on chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ripple-emulator-beta/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc?hl=en)

After successfully adding the ripple emulator to Google Chrome, head back to the app's URL url on your browser.

You should see the emulators icon on the rop right corner. Click on it and select the device you would like to emulate.
